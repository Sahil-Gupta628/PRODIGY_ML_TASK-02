# PRODIGY_ML_TASK-02

# Customer Segmentation of a retail store based on their purchase history.

# Description:
This project uses k-mean clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. The dataset used for this project is the "mall_customers.csv" dataset, which contains information on the customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score of 200 customers. The k-mean clustering algorithm is used to group the customers into different clusters based on their similarities in terms of their purchase behavior.

# Dependencies:
The following dependencies are needed to run this project:
.numpy
.pandas
.matplotlib
.seaborn
.sklearn

# Usage:
To run this project, you will need to install the dependencies listed above. Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project by following these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository.
Download the Mall_Customer.csv dataset to your system.
Open the PRODIGY_ML_02.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook.
Run the PRODIGY_ML_02.ipynb file.

# Results:
The k-mean clustering algorithm was able to create 5 different clusters of customers. The following are the characteristics of each cluster:

Cluster 1: Young, low-income customers with low spending scores.
Cluster 2: Middle-aged, middle-income customers with average spending scores.
Cluster 3: Middle-aged, high-income customers with high spending scores.
Cluster 4: Older, high-income customers with high spending scores.
Cluster 5: Young, high-income customers with low spending scores.

The mall or store management can use this information to target different marketing campaigns to each cluster of customers. For example, the mall management could target Cluster 1 with discounts on products that are popular with young, low-income customers. The mall management could also target Cluster 3 with high-end products that are popular with middle-aged, high-income customers.
